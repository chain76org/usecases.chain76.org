title: Blockchain Technology for drug resistance monitoring and clinical decision support for physicians
summary: DAKOTA Life Sciences is testing a blockchain-based platform for drug resistance monitoring. The platform integrates data secured from proprietary genomics-based global antibiotic efficacy surveillance networks to check for any fraudulent usage of antibiotics. This tool is expected to help in predicting the drug resistance patterns at global/regional/local levels to support physicians in clinical decision making.

### Problem statement

Difficulty in keeping information secure and also accessible to the correct parties for new global drug protection software. Excessive use of antibiotics is contributing to global drug resistance.

### Approach

The company is using blockchain and genomics technologies to protect new antibiotics that at present have very little drug resistance. This will extend the effective lives of new antibiotics. It is relying on the data security of blockchain technology and combining it with drug molecular structure monitoring.

Steven Keough, President of DAKOTA Life Sciences, explains that "DAKOTA Life Sciences views pharma drug security in several dimensions- including physical security, product integrity for the end-user patients, and also protection against global potency-limiting mechanisms." The scope of this vision initially led the Company to create tablet-level software to serve as a high-end decision support platform for infectious disease physicians.

### Technical details

The new software suite is designed to provide global protection for users of critical pharmaceuticals and enhanced logistics chain reliability. It integrates with multiple genomics databases in the cloud to ensure the correct medications were being used when treating polymicrobial-infected wounds.

Key aspects of this blockchain employment are its capabilities for: both public and private nodes, physical tracking and logistics, and also enabling never-before levels of local drug resistance monitoring. This, in turn, enables new capabilities for monitoring drug resistance patterns globally, and proper adjustment to those patterns to maintain the best patient care.
