title: Efficient and secure acquisition of human health and genomic data
summary: The company uses blockchain-based platform to build a marketplace for genomic and clinical data. It sequences participants’ genomes and then give users the agency to sell their personal data to researchers and pharmaceutical companies through a cryptocurrency. It also stores the participant’s genetic information in a blockchain based network.

### Problem statement

Companies are making money by using and selling health data of individuals without their permission. There is a need for privacy in highly sensitive DNA data.

### Approach

The company offers a way to standardize, centralize, and acquire genomic data while simultaneously protecting user privacy. It uses blockchain technology and gives the individual complete control of his/her data. The individual can choose to keep the data private or can get rewarded for securely and anonymously sharing with medical researchers.

### Technical details

If the individual decides to share their data, it is encrypted and analyzed by Intel Software Guide Extensions. The individuals retain the anonymity through cryptographic identifiers which won’t be matched to their identity. Also, the buyers will have to remain transparent so that the data owners know exactly who and how is their data being used. All the transactions are stored on the secure Nebula blockchain so there is a permanent record. The network is built on Blockstack technology and Nebula blockchain. Blockstack provides decentralized apps so that users can choose their own storage providers, like Dropbox, in order to store the data. All records are stored on the permanent Nebula blockchain. The company plans to keep currency with the Nebula network by using Nebula token as currency. The users will pay for genomic sequencing with Nebula tokens. Also, the data-buyers will use tokens to purchase this data. The data-buyers will get these tokens from Nebula Genomics for flat money. This will set up a cyclical system in which Nebula tokens will be used to both buy and sell data.
