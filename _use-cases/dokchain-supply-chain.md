title: DokChain - distributed network of transaction processors operating on financial and clinical data
summary: Partnering with Intel, PokitDok are calling their solution Dokchain. This blockchain-based platform helps in maintaining transparency. This would mean when a physician writes a prescription, it would be logged on the blockchain with the pricing clearly stated for the patient. The electronic capture of the prescription also helps in inventory and order management of medical supplies and drugs.

### Problem statement

Healthcare industry is troubled by inefficiencies mainly due to intermediaries such as clearinghouses and outdated technology vendors.

### Approach

Deploying distributed ledger technology across a wide range of health industry participants in order to bring intelligent and dynamic automation to core use case of context-relevant identity management and autonomous transaction validation and processing.

### Technical details

Dokchain provides identity management to validate each party involved in the transaction, whether it is a consumer or a provider. After validating the parties, the transactions between them can be processed immediately in a machine to machine communication based on agreed smart contracts. In the end, the blockchain can validate the supply chain so that, when a doctor writes a prescription, it gets logged on the chain with transparent pricing for the consumer. Also, this has broader implications for the inventory and order management. When all three above mentioned functions are combined, they provide a level of proof which makes it harder to introduce fraud into the system. This also eliminates much of the friction in the current workflow and ensures the privacy of patient data.
