### Problem statement

Data silos and lack of data provenance is very common in Biopharma, Healthcare, Medical Device Manufacturers and Life sciences industries.

### Approach

The company created Advanced Digital Ledger Technology (ADLT) platform (an interoperable platform) and can incorporate new technology like IoMT and facilitate Machine Learning and Big Data. By creating a network of trusted partners that are incentivized, it provides the solutions for easy transfer of information and creating new revenue models.

### Technical details

ADLT platform provides an interoperable solution for easy and secure data transfer and creates the source of data that is required for business/regulatory reasons. It is an enterprise blockchain solution that creates a distributed, highly secure, immutable, and auditable record of transactions between organizations.

ADLT platform has been developed since 2016, along with the creation of the BlockRx project, which is the iSolve's platform. By 2018, ADLT has been integrated with BlockRx-Pharma pilot ecosystem.
