### Problem statement

Administrative process related to professional credentialing is highly inefficient.

### Approach

In November 2018, ProCredEx announced launch of partner program with five leading health care enterprises. It will leverages advanced data science, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technologies to simplify the acquisition and verification of information related to professional credentialing.

### Technical details

The aim is to resolve the administrative inefficiencies in healthcare credentialing by using distributed ledger technology (DLT). The solution aims to connect existing credentialing systems. The exchange will simplify the current system by allowing a secure exchange of needed information, which will be freely available between exchange members.

In March, 2019, the Texas Hospital Association (THA) endorsed the ProCredEx as an exclusive partner to help Texas hospitals accelerate the process of credentialing healthcare practitioners. ProCredEx intends to grow the current partner program and increase the data available over the coming months.
