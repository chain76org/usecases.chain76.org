title: Provider licensure and credentialing
summary: In a pilot program, State of Illinois and Hashed Health collaborated to search for opportunities to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the medical credentialing process. The collaboration will leverage a registry based on blockchain to rationalize the sharing of medical credential data and smart contracts to automate process related to multistate and interstate licensure.

### Problem statement

There is no streamlined way of sharing the medical credential data and smart contracts - interstate licensing processes in Illinois is complex.

### Approach

State of Illinois has collaborated with Hashed Health in a pilot project to leverage blockchain and distributed ledger technologies to streamline the sharing of medical credential data and smart contracts. 

Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (IDFPR) Secretary Bryan Schneider, commented, “IDFPR’s active participation in efforts such as the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact and the Illinois Competitiveness Council shows our commitment to improving license portability for healthcare professionals. In the short-term we anticipate this pilot will show how distributed ledger technology can help reduce the complexity of interstate licensing processes in Illinois. In the long-term, we see this as a secure, privacy-enhancing way in which state licensure boards can efficiently manage credentialing at national scale, while also presenting health payers and provider networks a ‘single source-of-truth’ to improve the veracity of provider directories and claims adjudication processes.”
